# Daggerheart HUD

<img width="1110" height="711" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c232175-160b-4ff1-8222-4caf8892b376" />

## Watch it in action:

A heads-up display module for the Daggerheart system in Foundry VTT. Provides quick access to character resources and abilities without opening character sheets.

Select your token and the HUD will appear. It's that simple (always active and apply/remove conditions are a work in progress). **Double click** on the portrait opens the **character sheet.**

## Features

- **Central Portrait Ring**: Character portrait with hope pips and customizable ring frames
- **Weapon Actions**: Click left/right circles for primary/secondary weapon attacks
- **Resource Tracking**: HP, Stress, Evasion, Armor, and damage thresholds
- **Expandable Panels**: Access traits, features, inventory, and domain cards
- **Domain Management**: Move cards between loadout and vault
- **Customizable**: Ring images, color themes, and positioning

## Settings

### HUD Theme Configurator:
Do you like neat table pieces? Custom appearance for everyone? Crazy themes? Well, we got you fam!

### Other settings:
You can hide Foundry's macro hotbar, change the vertical position at which the HUD appears, or entirely disable it, while the other players can keep theirs (GMs tell the players where ro disable it)
